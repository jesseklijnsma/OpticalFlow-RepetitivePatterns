The top level of `fci_evaluation.json` contains the box blur kernel sizes used for calculating the reconstruction error. 
The reconstruction error is calculated by measuring the RGB difference between the actual second frame of the dataset, and the forward-warped pixels of the models prediction. 
This blur is applied to both the actual frame and the predicted frame, because the predictions almost cannot be pixel-accurate due to blending at sub-pixel movements.
